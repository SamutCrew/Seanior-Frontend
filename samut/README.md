This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## üìù Description

This frontend application serves as the user interface for the 'Online Platform for Connecting Learners with Swimming Coaches.' It enables learners to easily search for and connect with swimming coaches, and for coaches to manage their profiles and course offerings. By interacting with the dedicated backend API, this Next.js application aims to solve the problems of difficult searching and the unreliability of existing online channels, providing a convenient and user-friendly experience for both parties.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
